I recently hosted a workshop introducing students at Colorado State University to R, the tidyverse, and the V-Dem data set. We had a two hour workshop in which the students got familiar with R Studio, learned the basic functionality of R and the tidyverse, and started examining democracy indicators. It was a fast-paced workshop aimed and giving students some familiarity with coding and sparking interest and maybe even excitement about learning more.
