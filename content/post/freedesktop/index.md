Updating packages on my Ubuntu based Pop OS operating system recently I got an error message about the end of life of org.freedesktop.Platform 20.08


```
Looking for updatesâ€¦
Info: org.freedesktop.Platform.GL.default//20.08 is end-of-life, with reason:
   org.freedesktop.Platform 20.08 is no longer receiving fixes and security updates. Please update to a supported runtime version.
```

Solving this is pretty straightforward and can be done in three steps. 

First, check your list of flatpak packages


```
 flatpak list --runtime
```

You should see multiple `Freedesktop SDK` applications with the Application ID `org.freedesktop.Sdk`. You can see the version numbers as well. In my case, there were 20.8, 21.08.17.1, and 22.08.5. 

Using the follwing command we can remove the end of life version:

```
 flatpak remove org.freedesktop.Sdk
```

Running this will give you an option where you can select the version. You should pick `20.08` and afterwards confirm that you want to remove additional folders and files.

You are done with cleaning up. For good measure you can also remove unused packages:

```
 flatpak uninstall --unused
```
