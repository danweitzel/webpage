I recently conducted a workshop on academic writing in LaTeX, focusing on how researchers can efficiently structure documents, create professional presentations, and automate the integration of tables and figures using R. The session covered the basics of LaTeX syntax, document organization, and the use of Beamer for academic presentations. A key emphasis was placed on automating workflows to reduce manual formatting and improve reproducibility in research writing.

For anyone interested, all workshop materials are available in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/danweitzel/latex_workshop). The repository includes:

  - A LaTeX manuscript template demonstrating how to structure a research paper,
  - A Beamer presentation template for academic slides, and
  - An R script that generates tables and graphs based on 2020 ANES Pilot Study data, which are then automatically integrated into the LaTeX document.

The workflow demonstrated in the workshop shows how researchers can use R and LaTeX together to produce dynamic, well-formatted documents with minimal manual adjustments. The repository also contains setup instructions for installing LaTeX and using Sublime Text as an efficient editor for writing in LaTeX.
