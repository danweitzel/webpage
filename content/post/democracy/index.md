I have a one hour presentation at the 5th annual international symposium at Colorado State University. The topic of my talk was a globala ssessment of democracy with a deep dive into the U.S. case. We examined global trends in democratization and democratic backsliding as well as trends in the U.S. 

There was a special focus on media, Congress, parties, voters, and states. Below is code that replicates some of the figures I generated with publicly available data. 

You can check out the code on [Github Gist](https://gist.github.com/danweitzel/b82f6c4105e64b05609e84e8ef262be1) or examine it below. Let me know if you have any questions or suggestions!
