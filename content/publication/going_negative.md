abstract = "Why do political parties in multi-party competition attack each other? I argue that the larger number of parties and the coalition requirement in these systems increases the likelihood that negative campaigning backfires. Political parties therefore only use negative campaigning when these attacks appear legitimate. In multi-party systems driven by programmatic politics this means that we should see a focus on attacks related to policy proposals and not focused on the traits of individuals. Specifically, parties should attack their opponents on policies that belong to issues that they own. Using data from two recent elections each in twelve European countries I demonstrate that negative campaigning in multi-party systems is focused on incumbency and policy. Parties do not attack the character, honesty, or integrity of their competitors; instead, they hold governing parties accountable for their policies. The performance of parties in pre-election polls, while it is the central factor in two-party competition, is not an universal driver of negative campaigning across political systems."
